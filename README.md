# The Apartments Near Gyms Frontend

This is the frontend for the Apartments Near Gyms program.

The frontend, or the client, handles the landing page, user authentication, and displaying apartments and gyms to the user.

If the program is right for the user, the user will be able to hunt for apartments conveniently located near a gym in as little as five minutes.

The backend can be seen at this URL: https://github.com/rolandm2017/gymSaas

And the web scraper component lives here: https://github.com/rolandm2017/apScraper

Happy reading!
